I want to make an app that sell things, like hyped clothes and shoes. It will allow the sellers to register accounts and post pictures of the things that they want to sell. The platform will also let users to to message the sellers if they have any questions regarding the items and all payments are made through another secured platform, which is paypal. For the first round, I completed the signup process, which lets users to sign up with first and last name and also listing what they're selling.
It went well and and there is no changes to my big pictures. For the next round, I hope to accomplish the function of letting sellers to post pictures.
