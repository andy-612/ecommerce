## Big Picture
I want to make an app that sell things, like hyped clothes and shoes. It will allow the sellers to register accounts and post pictures of the things that they want to sell. The platform will also let users to to message the sellers if they have any questions regarding the items and all payments are made through another secured platform, which is paypal. 


## First Round
For the first round, I completed the signup process, which lets users to sign up with first and last name and also listing what they're selling.


## Test Plan for 1st round

Detailed tests for test user to follow, and/or function that can be unit tested.  For example:
>The user is prompted to enter an English phrase. 
>User enters "Hello". 
>The program prints "Nihao"


## Reflections
It went well and and there is no changes to my big pictures. 


## Next Steps
For the next round, I hope to accomplish the function of letting sellers add price
