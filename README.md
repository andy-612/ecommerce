I want to make an app that sell things, like hyped clothes and shoes. It will allow the sellers to register accounts and post pictures of the things that they want to sell. The app will let them input the price, the name of the products, the brand of the products, the description of the products and the price of the products. Once the item is posted, customers or any other sellers can comment on it and also have the choices to offer and to just purchase the item for the price the seller listed. Buyers also have the option of private messaging the sellers and negotiating prices. The app will charge each sell an 8% fees and will take paypal and credit card as options to pay.
For the first two weeks, I will be researching how to develop apps since i have no ideas yet on how to make one. Also, once I finished researching I will also start the basis of the app making process.
